# RioSwerve
A team agnostic pid-based swerve drive built in java. 

## Usage
This is meant to be used by any FIRST Team or other entity that wants to use it.
Although I no longer am associated with any FRC Team, I love the community and what everyone is attempting to achieve.

You will obviously have to modify the team number and package names to use any of this, but I don't know a better way of doing it

## Naming and Numbering
I attempt to number everything I can consistently. The general numbering system I use is as follows:
	         
	         Back
	     ____________
	     |          |
	     | 2      4 |
	     |          |
	Left |          | Right 
	     |          |
	     | 1      3 |
	     |__________|
	     
	        Front
